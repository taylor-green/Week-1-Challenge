# <Week-1-Challenge-Refactor>

## Description

Applied core concepts such as semantic HTML and CSS to webpage code in order to make the webpage more accesible and functional. Ensured that all links were fucntioning properly and that the HTML and CSS code were commented properly and layed out in a way that flowed logically. Coslidated elements in CSS code to reduce rendundancies. 



## Code and Tech

I utilized VS Code in order to go through code and make adjustments. Used to be able to look through webpage's HTML code and CSS style sheet to edit the attributes and apply these changes. 



## Features

Applied the skills recently learned to optimize webpage:
    -CSS
    -Semantic HTML
    -Git
Made CSS more efficient and consolidated by creating alternate classes in the HTML code and grouping similar elements together in one place. 
Added comments in both HTML and CSS where changes were made
